## Description: 
This will be my first capstone project using an API called Carbon Interface: 
- ðŸ‘£[Carbon Interface](https://docs.carboninterface.com/)

This simple application will utilize this API and provide a friendly UI to calculate a client's carbon footprints from transportation such as 
* Vehicles
* Shipping  
* Flights
* Electricity
